Honestly, this post is cause I don't want an empty directory until I _actually_ have something to post (it's not really coded yet). So, here's a little bit about me and this site. This post can act a bit like an About page, I guess.

# new blog, who this

Hi, I'm Evangelos (or Angel for short)--a PhD student studying Artificial Intelligence at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK. Though I'm also a chronic generalist with a large interest in music, language learning and video games, amongst other things.

## So, what even is this place?

This is my blog, a site I've pretty much always wanted to make but never really got around to doing until now. I don't know how often I'll post, but I just find myself going down rabbit holes upon rabbit holes very often and getting to know a lot of things that then lay in my mind until I eventually forget them, or until a friend of mine prompts me to remember them in some way.

Instead of just keeping my obscure rabbit hole findings to myself as an occasional party trick when talking to fellow nerds, I figured why not post about them. I enjoy writing, after all. Plus, the deeper I get into academia the more I find myself really learning a lot from other people's blogs and being inspired to contribute in the same way myself.

## And what'll you be posting about?

I'll probably mostly be posting about my research engineering projects, but I might also write generally about my research interests from time to time, or anything else I feel like writing about. Really, I'm just looking to have some sort of writing outlet online, and microblogging really isn't what I'm looking for, hence this site.
